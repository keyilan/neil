## Using this template

There are two ways to acquire the template files for your submission: downloading the files as a zip archive or cloning the repository. Once downloaded, you can edit `index.tex` with the content of your paper. Scroll down for information on editing.

### Downloading a zip file

The easiest way to download the template is as a zip file. You can download the files by [clicking here](https://github.com/keyilan/neils/archive/master.zip).

### Cloning the repo

To clone to your local system, you must first have `git` installed. If you are already familiar with `git`, simply clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/keyilan/neils.git` and edit the files from there. Note that you will not be pushing any changes to the master branch.

## Editing `index.tex`

It is important that you do not edit any of the files included in the template except `index.tex`, which holds the contents of your paper, and `references.bib` which contains all previously published works which your paper references.

For a guide on how to write citations in `references.bib`, see [this helpful guide](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/BIBTEX.HTM).
